# Housing Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing the housing dataset. The dataset is used to predict median house values in California districts, based on various features.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following main areas:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Importing necessary Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

2. **Download Dataset**: Downloading the dataset from a given URL.

3. **Preparing the Dataset**: Preparing the dataset by filtering records and handling missing values.

4. **Data Exploration**: Exploring the dataset by checking its shape, information, and summary statistics.

5. **Filling Null Values**: Handling missing values in the dataset.

6. **Data Transformation**: Applying transformations to the dataset, such as log transformation.

7. **Splitting Dataset**: Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

8. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training machine learning models (Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor) and evaluating their performance.

9. **Model Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

10. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyzing feature importance using a trained Random Forest Regressor.

11. **XGBoost Model Training**: Training an XGBoost model and tuning the `eta` parameter.

## Usage

To run this notebook and replicate the analysis:

1. Install the required Python libraries listed in the 'Importing Libraries' section.
2. Download the dataset using the provided URL in the 'Download Dataset' section.
3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform data analysis and model training.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to further customize the analysis according to your requirements.
